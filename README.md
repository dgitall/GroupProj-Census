# Exercise: Creating Visualizations While Exploring Data
 
## Part 1: Get into Groups and Review the API
Get into groups and review the following materials:

* Data provider: Census Bureau - https://api.census.gov/data.html
* Specific dataset: Annual Business Survey (ABS) APIs for 2019: https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/abs.2019.html
* Get an API key: https://www.census.gov/data/developers/guidance/api-user-guide.Help_&_Contact_Us.html
## Part 2: Explore the Dataset
Explore each of the endpoints individually to understand what data they provide. Explore them wholly to see how they connect.

You will have to consume the API, clean data, merge data, and transform data in order to show how they wholly connect.

Create visualizations as you explore using at least 2 visualization packages and at least 3 different visualizations per user in your group.

What have you found out about your data?

## Part 3: Present your Exploration
You will be presenting your findings to the class.

**Keep in mind that this is showing exploration.**
